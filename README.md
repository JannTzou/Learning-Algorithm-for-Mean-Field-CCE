# No-Regret Learning Algorithm for Optimal Mean-Field Coarse-Correlated Equilibrium

This file includes code for the project 'Optimal Mean-Field Coarse-Correlated Equilibrium: Linear Programming and No-Regret Learning' (coming soon to arXiv).

## Goal

The code provides a computational framework for learning **optimal coarse correlated equilibria (CCE)** in continuous mean-field games through **primal-dual** and **no-regret optimization schemes**.

The implementation is designed to connect the mathematical formulation of mean-field coarse correlated equilibria with reproducible numerical experiments. It contains experimental JAX implementations for

- simulating mean-field population dynamics under learned recommendation policies;
- estimating deviation values and external regret;
- training neural recommendation policies with primal-dual updates;
- monitoring ergodic objectives, regret estimates, and dual variables;
- visualizing convergence behavior and external-regret diagnostics.

Some examples are intended as validated benchmarks, while others are included as diagnostic experiments for testing modeling and numerical assumptions.

## Documentation roadmap

The documentation will be expanded with

- a detailed derivation of the primal-dual scheme;
- the connection between the linear-programming formulation and occupation measures;
- the numerical solution of the HJB equation;
- the construction of the best-deviation oracle;
- implementation details for population-aware policies;
- reproducible experiment tables;
- interpretation of the numerical results.
